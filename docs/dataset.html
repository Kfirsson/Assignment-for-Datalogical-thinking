                <h2>The long and winding road: Searching for, parsing and curating our data</h2>
                
                    <p>We started our group project with a relatively clear idea of what we wanted to find out —  
and this led us to believe that putting together the necessary dataset would be a relatively straightforward affair: we wanted to know “how Google has been critiqued in the academic literature”  and we agreed we would use Primo to get our data.</p>

<p>But: Homō putat, Deus mūtat — or, in our case, Datum mūtat.</p> 

<p>We conducted a quick initial search on Primo for <b><u>[google critique]</b></u> and this yielded a staggering 60,047 results.</p>

<p>This was quickly whittled down by refining the search to journal articles in peer-reviewed journals, published in English between 1998 and 2025. As the list was still rather long, we decided to try focusing on one journal only. We chose Big Data & Society, an open access, peer-reviewed scholarly journal that publishes interdisciplinary work principally in the social sciences, humanities and computing and their intersections with the arts and natural sciences about the implications of Big Data for societies. We felt that this would give us a broad enough range of writing in our dataset. This refined search returned a manageable list of 187 results from Primo.</p>

<p>We requested this list from Primo, turned it into a Google Sheet and rolled up our sleeves to parse and study our data. This included splitting the spreadsheet columns, using the <a href= "https://www.freewordcloudgenerator.com/">Free Word Cloud Generator</a> to create word clouds for the Title, Abstract and Keyword columns (to give us a better understanding of the issues/topics/concepts being written about), generating a list of the most common keywords and their frequencies, and simply reading through the individual entries.</p>

<img src= “img/curate4.jpg”>

<p>We quickly agreed that this initial dataset had a few obvious limitations:</p>

<p>Firstly, using only one journal - despite its interdisciplinary nature - is not representative of the academic literature and thus limits our ability to survey the state of the art with respect to Google critique.</p>

<p>Secondly, <i>Big Data & Society</i> has only been published since 2014 but Google has been around since 1998 - this omits 16 possible years of academic reactions to the corporation, its search engine and how its algorithm and more generally choices and actions affect society.* </p>

<p>(* Here we also discussed the possibility of looking at different periods in Google’s history, obvious inflection points such as the decision to leave China in 2010 or to ditch the “Don’t be evil” motto in 2018, and how these may or may not be reflected in the academic literature represented by our journal articles — a project some of us may return to another day!)</p>

<p>Thirdly, the initial search was so broad that our dataset included many keywords and topics at the periphery of our word clouds.</p>

<p>These most obvious limitations led us to agree to revisit our search on Primo, to refine it differently in order to gain access to a more discrete set of search results while at the same time expanding the scope of the search.</p>

<p>We changed the search terms to <b><u>[“google critique” OR “criticizing google” OR “critical of google”]</b></u>. This yielded a smaller set of 715 results — further refining it, to only peer-reviewed journals, reduced it to a manageable dataset with 53 results.</p>

<img src= “img/curate5.jpg”>

<p>Although we briefly entertained conducting additional searches for the sake of comparison, using different strategies to further refine the results and better hone in on our research focus, we agreed that the search results offered a solid dataset and that we should proceed to the next stages of the project. We thus requested the list once more from Primo and set about curating it.</p>
 
<p>As a first step, this involved asking ourselves what we wanted to actually do with the data - and therefore formulating more concrete research questions. We settled on:</p>

<ol><b>
<li>What are the keywords in the academic literature selected for our dataset? What is their frequency? What are the top 5 keywords?</li>
<li>How many articles related to these top 5 keywords have been published? What are their titles?</li> 
<li>Which authors have published articles with these top 5 keywords? How many articles has each author published using the top 5 keywords?
</li> 
</b></ol>


<p>With these questions in mind, we set about curating our data:</p>

<p>Firstly, we removed all attributes (columns) that are irrelevant to our research questions, leaving us with <b> Title, Author, Keywords, Description, Permalink </b></p>
<p>Secondly, we removed all duplicate article entries and all Swedish keywords that appeared as duplicates of listed English ones.</p>

<p>Thirdly, we manually checked every single field in every single row — to ensure it was filled and filled correctly.</p>

<p>Our diligent curation had brought us to an impasse: we had for easily justifiable reasons reduced the number of articles in our dataset to 49 — yet the assignment requires us to have at least 50! </p>
