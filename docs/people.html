                    <p>Czech-Canadian independent researcher and consultant specializing in the intersection of digital technologies, human rights and politics. With experience in both academia and the non-profit sector, I use my expertise to build bridges between these two worlds. I excel at crosscultural communication and collaborations in complex and politically sensitive environments. I speak English, Czech, German, French and Spanish; I have studied, worked and lived in 7 countries and travelled extensively and intensively in over 25. I am currently based in Prague with my husband, two grade schoolers and Frida, our energetic Vizsla.</p>

                    <p>IT-Librarian residing in Stockholm. I graduated from University of Borås in 2014 with a bachelor in information and library science, and currently I work as an IT-librarian at a public library just north of the city. I live with my wife (who is also a librarian and alumni of University of Borås) and two children (ages 8 and 4). Besides studying and working, I am the head coach for my son's football team (FORZA ÖRBY).</p>

                    <h3>Andre Rodewald</h3>
                    <p>German librarian that lives in the old capital of Bonn. I started working in libraries at the age of 17.  First I did a traineeship to become a specialist in media and information services and a few years later I followed up with studying for a bachelor's degree in library science. I have worked in a wide variety of libraries from metropolitan public libraries to highly specialised museum and university libraries. As a result, I have been able to get to know many fields of work: What I enjoy most is interacting with library users and creating services for all people. Especially Inclusion is a keyword for my interests. However Inclusion is unfortunately still a minor issue in many cities and municipalities. However, to have a few more sentences without the word library: I'm planning to move back to the seaside and the seagulls next year, as I originally come from the far north of Germany - from the beautiful state of Schleswig-Holstein. That's why I now enjoy the Rhine, the Rhineland as a whole and, above all, the beautiful Siebengebirge, right on Bonn's doorstep.</p>

                    <h3>Victor Villavicencio</h3>
                    <p>Originally from Chile but raised in Stockholm, I was certified as a multimedia producer as early as 1997 at the “Capital School of Multimedia”. I later studied graphic design at Forsbergs Skola. I earned a bachelor's degree in media technology from Södertörns Högskola, where I was invited to participate in the EU project Immigrant Inclusion by eParticipation (IIeP), which involved researching how social media could be used for social integration and inclusion.
My working career has taken me through various roles, including becoming one of the first webmasters, a network administrator, a web designer, an illustrator, a process developer, a tool designer in the process industry, and an art director. Today, I work as a Senior Creative at Art-O-Matic, where we specialise in bringing ideas to life by covering the final stages of advertising and information production.
I currently call Stockholm home, where my wife, an accomplished designer, is the second half of our design team. We have four adult 'kids', the youngest of which is now 24 years young, and a summer cottage in the countryside that I hope will soon welcome one of its semi-wild feline residents as a permanent house cat.
