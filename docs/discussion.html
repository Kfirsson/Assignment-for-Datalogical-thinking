                <h2>Discussion</h2>

            <p>What seemingly began as a straightforward “we have a range of training and expertise in our group so we are well placed to just roll up our sleeves and get it done” type of project of course turned out to be much more than that. We therefore felt it necessary to add a final discussion-cum-reflection layer to our project.</p>

            <p>During the dataset stage, we deliberated the importance of search terms and discussed the implications of how the search tools we use are structured, agonized over how expected findings often did not match the reality of the retrieved results (whether regarding the content or the format of the data), and had to admit that our own training, experience and bias meant that decisions about how to actually curate the data were not always unanimous. We nevertheless completed this stage with a well-formed dataset with 50 items as per the assignment requirements.</p>

            <p>The algorithm stage, then, was like the first stage — but on steroids. We agreed quickly enough as a group on the general terms of what we wanted the algorithm to achieve and even on the logic of the particular steps that should get us there. And had we left the entire enterprise at the pseudocode level, things would likely have gone rather smoothly. But Victor decided that he needed to charm the Python (and charm it he did in the end!). The process was a slightly painful and protracted one — not only for Victor, who took on the mammoth task of learning a new coding language in the space of a few days, but for our entire group — with many iterations of code and frequent and polite but slightly heated exchanges about what the output did or did not show and why. During this process we all noticed that we had a communication problem — nothing to do with not being polite or constructive but everything to do with not being able to understand each other. In short, what the research thought it wanted and needed was not always immediately what the code could and did do. But persistence paid off and the algorithm stage was completed with an output that answered the questions we had wanted to ask of the data.</p>   

            <p>This project allowed all of us to learn new digital research skills (both in terms of thinking and in terms of execution) but also forced us to pivot several times (we discuss some of this on the <a href="dataset.html"  target="_blank">dataset</a> and <a href="algorithm.html"  target="_blank">algorithm</a> pages in more detail). The reasons for these changes in our trajectory were in part due to circumstance (data) and in part due to skill (code). Our false starts, setbacks and course adjustments highlighted the importance of clear communication at all stages of a (digital) research project and provided unexpected opportunities for learning and reflection along with a discussion about the role that information scientists can and should play in the research process.</p>

            <p>Information science, often referred to as an interdisciplinary science, has the associated advantage of acting as a bridge builder. Information scientists close an essential gap, as they can understand the requirements of specialized scientists (the need for clear data or the formulation of research questions), but also have a basic understanding of structuring data and different data types. Accordingly, clear communication, which, as we have seen, is essential for the success of projects such as this group project, can be facilitated by the information scientist acting as a sort of mediator in the research process. The example of our group illustrates very well how collaboration between researchers, software developers and information scientists might work.</p>



                <h2>Reflections</h2>


<p>Klara: “I came into this project wearing my researcher hat: I had a clear idea of a research focus and a few hypotheses in my pocket and was ready to course-correct as needed. However, the curveballs thrown by the data and code took me by surprise. This project made me ponder data integrity but also transparency and rigour in research. And it was an illuminating exercise in how to communicate what needs to be computed and how to meaningfully present what has been computed to make it useful for further interpretation. Our different experiences and expectations sometimes complemented and sometimes clashed with each other — luckily there was always one of us willing to step back and act as mediator between our different worlds.”</p> 

<p>Einar: “”</p> 

<p>Andre: “With my professional background as a librarian, I went into the project with confidence. For me, thinking about the extent to which content needs to be presented digitally is a daily task, but I realised how different the thought and action processes are. As a librarian who works primarily in the library services sector, I have a lot of contact with library customers. So I was mainly looking at what is expected. I noticed throughout the project that I needed to understand a lot more the terminology and why data is visualised and how. Especially since we have already established the link to information science as a bridge builder, I noticed that I still often only have a sketchy understanding of what requirements are necessary in the respective areas. I was very pleased about the structure of our group and the many discussions and back- and forth situations. But I am also aware of the fact that for a “real-world” setting I do have to take a better understanding to fulfil the position as the Information Scientist aka bridgebuilder.”</p>
