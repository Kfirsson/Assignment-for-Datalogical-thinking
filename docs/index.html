                <p>
                    Search engines have become <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2ecw6kr9">“one of society’s key infrastructures for knowing and becoming informed”</a>. 
                    The term ‘Google it’ is slowly replacing ‘find out’. But how many Google users actually stop to think critically about the dominant search engine and the results it retrieves?  
                </p>
                <p>
                 With this idea in mind, we — <a href="people.html">a Swedish IT librarian, a Chilean-Swedish visual storyteller with an activist bent, a
                 German librarian interested in digital inclusion, and a Czech-Canadian jaded ICT4D researcher and free speech advocate </a> — 
                decided to look at the academics who do just that and so we turned to Primo in search of academic writing offering <b>critical interrogation</b>, <b>critique</b> — or even outright <b>criticism</b> — 
                    of Google for our group project for the fall 2024 module of Datalogical Thinking, part of the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mw9npsf6">Master’s Programme in Information Science: Digital Environments</a> at the University of Borås.   
                </p>
                <p>
                   Using the retrieved <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ysrmr3pv">Primo search results</a> we created <a href="dataset.html">a dataset</a> of peer-reviewed journal articles and then <a href="algorithm.html">an algorithm</a> using pseudocode and Python to answer the following questions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>What are the keywords in our dataset? What are the top 5 keywords in our dataset?</li>
                    <li>How many articles in our dataset include these top 5 keywords? What are their titles?</li>
                    <li>How many authors in our dataset have written on these top 5 keywords? What are their names?</li></ol>
                <p>As we explain in the discussion, we added a fourth and final step and we asked the algorithm to create a word cloud from the descriptions of all articles in our dataset.
                </p>
                <p>Our dataset and the process of its curation can be found <a href="dataset.html">here</a>.
                    What considerations went into the design of our algorithm, along with the pseudocode and Python script are found <a href="algorithm.html">here</a>. We include our output and a final discussion <a href="output.html">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had many interesting discussions along the way — not just about whether Google is evil but also about what meaningful questions we can and should pose as aspiring information scientists, how to pose them to better find what we are looking for, how to structure and curate the raw data that our search returned, why not everything in a retrieved search is useful, how to ask relevant questions of our data, how to think like a computer and structure an algorithm so that it retrieves the information we want from the data, and what all the output might mean for possible further research.

<p>The team would like to acknowledge the irony that much of this tiny project to critically interrogate a giant Google was made possible thanks to our use of Google Meet, Google Docs and Google Sheets. </p>

<p>A big thanks also goes to Frida the Vizsla for her frequent opinions during our video meetings.</p>
