                <p>
                    Search engines have become <a href="https://tinyurl.com/2ecw6kr9">“one of society’s key infrastructures for knowing and becoming informed”</a>. 
                    The term ‘Google it’ is slowly replacing ‘find out’. But how many Google users actually stop to think critically about the dominant search engine and the results it retrieves?  
                </p>
                <p>
                 With this idea in mind, we — a Swedish IT librarian, a Chilean-Swedish visual storyteller with an activist bent, a
                 German librarian interested in digital inclusion, and a Czech-Canadian jaded ICT4D researcher and free speech advocate (link to people.html) — 
                decided to look at the academics who do just that and so we turned to Primo in search of academic writing offering critical interrogation, critique — or even outright criticism — 
                    of Google for our group project for the fall 2024 module of Datalogical Thinking, part of the <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mw9npsf6">Master’s Programme in Information Science: Digital Environments at the University of Borås</a>.   
                </p>
                <p>
                   Using the retrieved <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ysrmr3pv">Primo search results</a> we created <a href="dataset.html">a dataset</a> of peer-reviewed journal articles and then <a href="algorithm.html">an algorithm </a> using pseudocode and Python to answer the following questions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the keywords in our dataset? What are the top 5 keywords in our dataset?</li>
                    <li>How many articles in our dataset include these top 5 keywords? What are their titles?</li>
                    <li>How many authors in our dataset have written on these top 5 keywords? What are their names?</li></ul>
                <p>>As we explain in the discussion, we added a fourth and final step, we asked the algorithm to create a word cloud from the descriptions of all articles in our dataset.
